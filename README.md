This repository  is under  heavy refactoring.  Trust me,  it's not  worth your
time... for now.

Welcome to  the land  of silly  witticisms and  shamelessly stolen,  banged up
semi-working snippets  of obscure code,  where lame jokes and  dark references
run galore.

This repository is  a strictly personal collection of  loosely coupled, mostly
failed  experiments and/or  thoughts.  I try  to  keep everything  filterless,
meaning I dump  whatever I have on my  mind at the time of  writing, which can
consist of  sometimes extremely  basic explanation  that a  2 year  old should
already be aware of. Whatever is written should be taken with a grain of salt.

Enough with the poor  banter, this here is my meager  attempt at rebuilding my
dotfiles following the  [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm. Being a  sucker for the
darker parts of computer science culture, history, and discipline, I feel this
is the  perfect opportunity  to learn a  new paradigm and  to get  myself more
acquainted to  the inner workings  of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/)  and [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) ~~following  my recent
shift from the [dark side](https://neovim.io/).~~ Scratch that, I couldn't in the end ... The literate
programming part still stands true.
