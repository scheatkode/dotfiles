Welcome to the land of silly witticisms and shamelessly stolen, banged up
semi-working snippets of obscure code, where lame jokes and dark references
run galore.

This repository is a strictly personal collection of loosely coupled, mostly
failed experiments and/or thoughts. I try to keep everything filterless,
meaning I dump whatever I have on my mind at the time of writing, which can
consist of sometimes extremely basic explanation that a 2 year old should
already be aware of. Whatever is written should be taken with a grain of salt.

Enough with the poor banter, this here is my meager attempt at keeping my
dotfiles up to date in case of catastrophic system failures and following the
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm. Being a sucker for the darker parts of the
computer science culture, history, and discipline, I feel this is the perfect
opportunity to learn a new paradigm.
