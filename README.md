Welcome to the land of silly witticisms and shamelessly stolen, banged up
semi-working snippets of obscure code, where lame jokes and dark references
run galore.

This repository is a strictly personal collection of loosely coupled, mostly
failed experiments and/or thoughts. I try to keep everything filterless,
meaning I dump whatever I have in mind at the time of writing, which can
range from extremely basic explanation that a 2 year old should
already be aware of, to commit messages that would put a sailor to shame.
Whatever is written should be taken with a grain of salt.

Enough with the poor banter, this here is my meager attempt at keeping my
dotfiles up to date in case of catastrophic system failures and following the
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm; or simply being an enabler to myself for
distro-hopping. Being a sucker for the darker parts of the computer science
culture, history, and discipline, I feel this is the perfect opportunity to
learn a new paradigm and discover newer, darker corners.

But before you embark on this perilous adventure, *it's dangerous to go alone,
take this*.
